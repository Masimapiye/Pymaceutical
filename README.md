### The study aimed to balance the number of male mice to female mice to reduce gender bias. It also had comparable distribution of mice numbers across the different drug regimens.
### The data suggests that Capomulin is the most effective at treating SCC. The data also highlights that Ramicane is also comparably effective as a treatment option for SCC. 
### Further detailed analysis of Ramicane would need to be considered. Based on the output from the box plots both drug regimens could be strongly considered as treatment options.
### The greatest decrease in Tumour Volume with Capomulin occurs between 30 to 45 days from when treatment is commenced. This would be vital if this drug was to undergo clinical trials in humans as this indicates the possible optimum treatment plan schedule.
### There  is a strong and positive relationship between tumour volume and weight of the mouse as highlighted by the positive linear regression model generated from the Capomulin  regimen mice data. This means that the higher the weight of a mouse the higher the tumour volume.
